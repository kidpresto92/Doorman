# Doorman

This was a school project for embedded systems that runs on a raspberry pi with wifi and an attached webcam. It takes a picture and emails it to the specified recipients. This was originally created to be sent to my phone using my service provider's sms service (7164356581@mms.att.net) 

# Getting Started

You'll need to set up a Gmail account with "Allow less secure apps" enabled. To do this, log into the email account and go to the "Sign-in & security" page. From here, you'll have to scroll to the bottom and enable "Allow less secure apps"
